                    <p class="text">
                        Two brothers served as sailors aboard an ocean freight ship, but 
                        tragedy struck when a shipwreck claimed the life of the younger 
                        sibling. From that moment onward, the elder brother was 
                        burdened by remorse, haunted by the decision to prioritize his 
                        own survival over that of his brother.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The shipwreck left him grappling with severe Post-Traumatic 
                        Stress Disorder(PTSD), plunging him into recurrent nightmares. 
                        In these dreams, he continually tried to escape the sinking 
                        vessel, dashing through successive doors, yet he remained 
                        ensnared. His psyche was ensnared by the events of that fateful 
                        night. With the unwavering support of friends and family, he 
                        embarked on a journey of psychological healing and, guided by 
                        the psychotherapist, he once more delved into the realm of 
                        dreams. This time, he was determined to find a path towards 
                        redemption.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">The core of the game lies the concept of "escaping through 
                        doors." In this dreamlike realm, we break free from the confines 
                        of traditional spatial rules, introducing a range of non-Euclidean 
                        spaces and gameplay mechanics. Players are tasked with 
                        employing their creativity and intelligence to uncover clues while 
                        gradually delving into the depths of the protagonist's inner world. 
                        Originally conceived as a course assignment, this project is still in 
                        development.</p>

                    <p class="text">For game art design, we began by analyzing the background story and conducting initial 
                        concept design. Using these concepts, we crafted the game scenes in Blender, which will 
                        later be imported into Unity.</p>

                                door serves as both an entrance and exit, but upon entering, a key must be found to 
                                reopen it. The main gameplay involves retrieving keys from paintings.</p>

                                space that defies the rules of perspective. The gameplay can be summarized as "nearer

                                In the maze, players initially can choose between two 
                                paths, but both return to the the starting point due to a portal.
                                The only escape is by walking backward into what appears as a dead-end.</p>

                                    using Unity, and VR is supported by PICO 4.</p>
